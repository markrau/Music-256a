Description: Addative synthesizer with 5 oscillators. Each oscillator has
a frequency and gain control. The oscillator can also be played with an external 
input on channel 0. There is a master gain control for all oscillators (but not the external input). 
The "snap harmonic" button forces oscillators 2-5 to be the closest frequency to their slider value 
which is a harmonic of slider 1.
